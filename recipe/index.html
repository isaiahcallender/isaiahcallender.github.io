<h1> <strong> <em>  Mac and Cheese </strong> </em>  </h1>

Ah, mac and cheese, or as we might say, macaroni au fromage! It is a delightful, yet simple dish, non? Tender macaroni, perfectly cooked al dente, bathed in a luxurious, velvety cheese sauce—most often a rich cheddar or a blend of fromages, melted to perfection. It is creamy, indulgent, with a hint of elegance in its simplicity. You can finish it with a golden crust in the oven, perhaps a touch of breadcrumbs for that crunch. A dish that is humble, yet irresistible—comforting like a warm embrace! Bon appétit!

<h2> Ingredients    </h2>
<ul> 
<li> Macaroni or Pasta </li> 
<li> Cheese </li> 
<li> Milk </li> 
<li> Salt </li> 
<li> Nutmeg </li> 
<li> Mustard </li> 

</ul>



Magnifique! Now, the journey to the perfect mac and cheese begins!   
<br>

<li> <strong> <em>  Ah, the first step for a perfect mac and cheese begins </em> </strong> <br>
Faire bouillir l’eau: Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil, and add a generous pinch of salt—comme la mer, like the sea! Once the water is bubbling, add your macaroni, letting it dance in the pot. Cook al dente, about 7 to 8 minutes—firm but tender! Drain it and set it aside, but do not rinse! You want the pasta to hold onto that luscious cheese sauce later. </li>

<li>  <strong> <em>  Prepare the roux: </strong> </em>  <br>
	In a saucepan over medium heat, melt butter—about 2 tablespoons will do. Once it’s melted and bubbling, sprinkle in an equal amount of flour. Stir continuously with a whisk for about 2 minutes, until it forms a smooth paste, golden but not browned. Voilà, this is the roux, the magical base for your sauce.
Next, we will transform this into a creamy dream, but patience, mon ami! </li> 

<li> <strong> <em>  Make the béchamel: </strong> </em> <br>
 Slowly pour in about 2 cups of milk (or a mix of milk and cream, if you prefer extra richness) while whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Keep stirring as the mixture heats and thickens, about 5 to 7 minutes. You’ll want it smooth and creamy, like a luxurious blanket.
Once thickened, season with a pinch of salt, pepper, and if you’re feeling fancy, a small dash of nutmeg or mustard to enhance the flavor!</li> 

<li> <strong> <em>  Add the cheese: </strong> </em> <br>
 Reduce the heat to low, and gradually stir in about 2 to 3 cups of your chosen cheese. Start with a sharp cheddar, but feel free to add a bit of Gruyère, mozzarella, or even parmesan for that je ne sais quoi. Stir slowly until the cheese melts completely into the sauce, creating a smooth, creamy, and luscious mixture.
At this point, the sauce should be rich and silky, clinging to the whisk like a masterpiece. Taste it—mais oui, perfection! Now, we’re ready to unite it with the pasta.
</li>

<li> <strong> <em>  Combine pasta and sauce: </strong> </em> <br>
 Gently fold the cooked macaroni into the luscious cheese sauce. Stir until every piece of pasta is coated in that rich, creamy goodness. At this point, you can taste again for seasoning—perhaps a pinch more salt or pepper if needed.
Now, you can serve it as is for a stovetop mac & cheese—simple, creamy, and comforting.</li>
