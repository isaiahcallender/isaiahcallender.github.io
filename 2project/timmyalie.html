<h1> <strong> TIMMY ???? </strong> </h1>

<p>
You tell a lie,<br>
You point in a random direction <br>  <br> <br> 

He say his mom is at home and sees through your deception. <br> 
Timmy's trust in you begins to fade away. <br> <br>

He takes a few steps back, <br>
Timmy reaches into his pocket. <br>
What will u do? <br>
